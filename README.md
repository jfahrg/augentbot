Full license text:

                1. This LICENSE AGREEMENT is between the Python Software Foundation ("PSF"), and
                the Individual or Organization ("Licensee") accessing and otherwise using Python
                3.5.4 software in source or binary form and its associated documentation.

                2. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License Agreement, PSF hereby
                grants Licensee a nonexclusive, royalty-free, world-wide license to reproduce,
                analyze, test, perform and/or display publicly, prepare derivative works,
                distribute, and otherwise use Python 3.5.4 alone or in any derivative
                version, provided, however, that PSF's License Agreement and PSF's notice of
                copyright, i.e., "Copyright © 2001-2017 Python Software Foundation; All Rights
                Reserved" are retained in Python 3.5.4 alone or in any derivative version
                prepared by Licensee.

                3. In the event Licensee prepares a derivative work that is based on or
                incorporates Python 3.5.4 or any part thereof, and wants to make the
                derivative work available to others as provided herein, then Licensee hereby
                agrees to include in any such work a brief summary of the changes made to Python
                3.5.4.

                4. PSF is making Python 3.5.4 available to Licensee on an "AS IS" basis.
                PSF MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.  BY WAY OF
                EXAMPLE, BUT NOT LIMITATION, PSF MAKES NO AND DISCLAIMS ANY REPRESENTATION OR
                WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR THAT THE
                USE OF PYTHON 3.5.4 WILL NOT INFRINGE ANY THIRD PARTY RIGHTS.

                5. PSF SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE OR ANY OTHER USERS OF PYTHON 3.5.4
                FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR LOSS AS A RESULT OF
                MODIFYING, DISTRIBUTING, OR OTHERWISE USING PYTHON 3.5.4, OR ANY DERIVATIVE
                THEREOF, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF.

                6. This License Agreement will automatically terminate upon a material breach of
                its terms and conditions.

                7. Nothing in this License Agreement shall be deemed to create any relationship
                of agency, partnership, or joint venture between PSF and Licensee.  This License
                Agreement does not grant permission to use PSF trademarks or trade name in a
                trademark sense to endorse or promote products or services of Licensee, or any
                third party.

                8. By copying, installing or otherwise using Python 3.5.4, Licensee agrees
